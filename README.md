  - Goal: Stock market forecasting is very important in the planning of business activities and hence has been a hot topic for various researchers. News sentiment is one of the most important factor that drives the stock price and hence an AI based tool which could predict the stock price in advance would thus be of great use.

## Idea 2:
  - Title: Smart Personal Pantry
  - Description: A smart personal pantry management system which will give you the recipies that you could cook based on the ingredients available and also send alerts to restock food items which might be required.
  - Goal: In todays fast paced life keeping track of what to cook everyday based on the available ingredeints is often quite cumbersome. Also keeping track of food items needed and currently available is tedious. This often results in either the food ingredient not available when needed or it being completely wasted. Each person in US is estimated to waste about a pound of food per day. An AI based Personal Pantry manager would be of great help to solve the above problem. Also getting to know about new recipies that you could cook is always an addon.
