## Project Details
  - **Title**: Privacy Focused Identification System
  - **Description**:
  - **Goal**: In today's world where data privacy is an everyday concern, the app aims to provide granular control of identity information to any organization. The application will scan your government issued IDs and extract information from the ID with the help of OCR and image classification. The extracted identity information will be stored in a centralized encrypted database. Whenever an organization requests some identity information like age, place of birth, etc., the application will only provide that piece of information to the organization and at the same point protect other aspects of the identity information. This would help reveal only the data that is required to the concerned party and keep all the other data hidden. 
  - **Technology Stack**: Hyperledger Indy, Python/Node based framework as backend language, React/Angular based frontend
