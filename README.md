## Idea 1:
  - **Title**: Stock Price Predictor
  - **Description**: An AI based application to predict stock price of a particular company on the following day using news sentiments and moving averages.
  - **Goal**: Stock market forecasting is crucial in business planning and hence has been a hot topic for various researchers. It is an intersection of various domains such as computer science, finance and business. News sentiment is one of the most important factor that drives the stock price and hence an AI based tool which could predict the stock price in advance would thus be of great use.
  - **Technology Stack**: Python based framework as backend language, Scikit Learn, Tensor Flow, React/Angular based frontend, Databases (SQLite, Mongo/Dynamo)
  
## Idea 2:
  - **Title**: Smart Personal Pantry
  - **Description**: A smart personal pantry management system which can recommend recipies that you could cook based on the ingredients available in your pantry and also send alerts to restock food items which might be required.
  - **Goal**: In todays fast paced life keeping track of what to cook everyday based on the available ingredeints is often quite cumbersome. Also keeping track of food items needed and currently available is tedious. This often results in either the food ingredient not available when needed or it being completely wasted. Each person in US is estimated to waste about a pound of food per day. An hybrid AI based Personal Pantry manager mobile application would be of great help to solve the above problem. Also getting to know about new recipies that you could cook is always an addon.
  - **Technology Stack**: Python based framework as backend language, (Ionic Framework, ApacheCordova/React Native) for mobile application frontend, Relational Database (Postgres, MariaDB, MysqlDB, Amazon RDS)
  
## Idea 3:
  - **Title**: Privacy Focused Identification System
  - **Description**: A system designed to verify your identity with focus on privacy protection. The application will enable user to only reveal part of their identity that is required by the third-party service provider. 
  - **Goal**: In today's world where data privacy is an everyday concern, the app aims to provide granular control of identity information to any organization. The application will scan your government issued IDs and extract information from the ID with the help of OCR and image classification. The extracted identity information will be stored in a centralized encrypted database. Whenever an organization requests some identity information like age, place of birth, etc., the application will only provide that piece of information to the organization and at the same point protect other aspects of the identity information. This would help reveal only the data that is required to the concerned party and keep all the other data hidden. 
  - **Technology Stack**: Python based framework as backend language, React/Angular based frontend, Image recongnition library, Relational Database (Postgres, MariaDB, MysqlDB, Amazon RDS)
